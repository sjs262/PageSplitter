# PageSplitter
A Java program for splitting a PNG into multiple printable pages, in a PDF file.

I write the answers to my math homework in the Concepts app on my iPad. This produces a PNG with a black background and white handwriting.  

The only problem with this is that I need to turn my homework via physical copy, and large, black-background images are not especially printable.  

The solution to this is a quick and dirty Java program I made that, when inputted with PNG files, can output an inverted PDF of them that is split up between multiple 8.5"x11" pages.
